 <p>In the past couple decades, Major League Baseball has seen a worrying trend. The league had a significant number of Black players going back just one generation, but this trend has completely reversed. The number of Black players is as low as it has been since the 1950s. The league has seen this drop, which is not only affecting the player base but also the influence of the game in popular culture.


Why did this sudden change happen in the first place, and what is being done to increase not only the amount of Black players, but also increase opportunities for other groups and make the sport more diverse from the top down?
</p>
 <p>Almost 80 years ago, Jackie Robinson became the first Black player to break the color barrier in MLB. After teams initially refused to integrate, the number of Black players grew dramatically when the league went from only a handful to almost 20% of all players on a roster being Black in the mid-1980s. </p>

 </script>


<p>However, just a few decades after that, the league has seen a worrying change in this trend. Only 6.2% of players on MLB rosters at the start of the 2023 season were Black. The reason for this downturn is most likely due to how the path to the Major Leagues has changed over time. </p>


<p>The rising cost of the sport for younger athletes, specifically in certain pipelines to the Major Leagues such as Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) baseball have had a damaging effect on the diversity of the game. AAU, more commonly known as travel baseball, is made up of teams from major towns and cities across the country that play other regional teams as well as major tournaments compromising teams from all over the country. It is the circuit with the most eyes on it, from audiences on social media to scouts from Major League teams trying to find players to draft to their teams. </p>


<p>Although travel baseball can be a way for young players to be coached and gain exposure, there are certain issues that can end up not giving all players this opportunity. The most glaring issue is the cost of travel baseball, with estimates ranging from at least $500 to possibly thousands of dollars per season. This burden is exacerbated by the hundreds that families have to spend on baseball equipment, such as bats, gloves, and cleats. This is obviously not a cost that every family can afford, and as Black families have one of the lowest median incomes in the country, more Black players are priced out as the costs keep rising. </p>


<p>This trend is obviously impossible for MLB officials to ignore. There have been a number of programs to increase Black participation in baseball, specifically through the creation of the Player’s Alliance program. The program, which has been partnered with MLB since 2020, is a non-profit organization made up of current and former players that creates programs to increase access and opportunities for Black baseball players. </p>


<p>One of the initiatives that have been created is a mentorship program for players just entering the baseball world to connect with former players. The Player’s Alliance is also targeting the financial obstacles for Black players. The organization runs individual baseball youth leagues as well as creating new tournaments that are separate from the costly AAU and travel tournaments. Another example is the Gear for Good program, an equipment drive for Black community groups to help lower the cost of getting Black youth into the sport. MLB initially donated $10 million to the group, but in 2021 committed to paying the initiative $150 million over the following 10 years. </p>


<p>An example from its own history that MLB might try to repeat is the growth of Latino players. Into the 1990s, only about 10% of all players were Latino, and the number was not showing meaningful growth.</p>
<p>In the 90s, however, teams started running baseball academies in Latin America, specifically in the Dominican Republic, and the percentage of players that are Latino have shot up to 30%. Similar investment in the Black community is a potential way to see the same growth.</p>
<iframe title="Latino Players in MLB" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-7hwY5" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/7hwY5/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="400" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();</script>


<p>Due to the lengthy path to the Majors that most young players face, it is too soon to see whether these types of programs are having a definite impact on the sport. But some news has been encouraging: in the 2022 MLB draft, four of the first five players taken were Black. Although the league is facing a crisis, it is clear that there is an effort being made to remedy the problem and increase access to the game.
There have been other efforts to diversify the game further. As the Players Alliance strives to bring more Black players both to the game and to executive roles, there has been an effort to bring more women into MLB. Events like Take The Field bring more roles for women in coaching and front office roles, two positions that are heavily owned by white males. The event had 66 applicants for its first event in 2018, and over 500 in 2023, just five years later. As more teams are becoming open to hiring women in predominantly male positions, there have been a number of success stories.</p>


<p>Kim Ng, who had been in baseball operations since 1990, was named the first women general manager of any of the four major sports leagues when she was hired by the Miami Marlins in 2020, as well as being the first person of East Asian descent to hold such a role. She had an immediate positive impact on the team, as the Marlins made the playoffs in 2023 for just the fourth time in the team’s entire history, notably doing so under some of the tightest budget constraints of any general manager.</p>


<p>Alyssa Nakken became the first woman to serve on a coaching staff when she was hired by the San Francisco Giants, who had the most wins of any team the year after they hired her. In October 2023, she was the first woman to be interviewed for a managerial role. The increasing opportunities for women, and other underrepresented groups in general, have shown teams that limiting hirings to a certain pool can deprive front offices of the best candidates. </p>


<p>Time and time again, baseball has shown that when it allows itself to include more groups, good things have followed, from Jackie Robinson to Kim Ng helping their teams to win after years of losing and increasing opportunities for those who initially did not have any. Although the problem of a lack of diversity was largely ignored for multiple decades, Major League Baseball has shown a commitment monetarily to increase access for underrepresented groups in baseball.
